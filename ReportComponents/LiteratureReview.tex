\section{Literature review}
If you have a literature review you need to describe the process by which you found papers and the way you narrowed the search to a smaller set of papers to review.  This would include the framework you were using to assess the papers.

\subsection{Introduction/background(for the review?)}
    * Topic: 
    * Games for Education - Programming
        * How are these games incorporating intrinsic/extrinsic motivators to motivate their players and what are the strengths and weaknesses of the used approaches?

\subsection{Methods}
    * Google Scholar
        * "serious games" "education" "programming" "intrinsic" "extrinsic" "motivation" OR "motivators"
        * After 2014
        * 531 results
        * Papers from the first three pages were picked:
            * As long as they weren't a survey/literature review
                * Primarily because I want to focus on actual papers and their approaches to motivating players. 
            * As long as keywords in either title or abstract included "programming" and intrinsic/extrinsic motivations. The papers also had to be related to serious games for education. 
                * To make sure it is relevant to the topic
        
        * 3 papers were picked out for further reading based on the criteria. (Page 1)
        * 2 papers were picked out for further reading based on the criteria. (Page 2)
        * 0 papers were picked out for further reading based on the criteria. (Page 3)
        * 2 papers were set aside as potentially interesting to read in relation to the topic of motivations despite not including the term "programming" or being related to education 

    * IEEE Xplore
        * "serious games" "education" "programming" "intrinsic" "extrinsic" "motivation" OR "motivators"
        * 12 results by default
        * Papers were picked based on the same criteria as Google scholar.
        
        * 1 paper was picked out for further reading as it was the only one related to programming and intrinsic/extrinsic motivation keywords. 
        * 1 paper was set aside as potentially interesting to read in relation to the topic of motivations despite not including the term "programming" or being related to education 
        
    * How were the papers found? 
    * How was the process for narrowing down the search to a smaller set of papers?
    * How was the quality of papers assessed?
        * A bunch of factors
    
\subsection{Results}
    * Discussing the area
    * What are the similarities between the papers?
        * Their theory?
        * Their goals?
        * What could be used to make a better game?
    * Self determination theory is relevant to mention in relation to motivation
    
    * Case study on the 5 papers you actually read through. 
        * What are their strengths and weaknesses?
        * Does it seem like their approaches make sense?
        * What is the argument we can make here?
            * What is lacking that requires more research?
        * Can their approaches be tied to theory we learned in class?
