  Conventional taught learning practices often experience difficulties in keeping students motivated and engaged.
Video games, however, are very successful at sustaining high levels of motivation and engagement through a set of tasks
for hours without apparent loss of focus. In addition, gamers solve complex problems within a gaming environment
without feeling fatigue or frustration, as they would typically do with a comparable learning task. Based on this notion, the
academic community is keen on exploring methods that can deliver deep learner engagement and has shown increased
interest in adopting gamification – the integration of gaming elements, mechanics, and frameworks into non-game
situations and scenarios – as a means to increase student engagement and improve information retention. Its effectiveness
when applied to education has been debatable though, as attempts have generally been restricted to one-dimensional
approaches such as transposing a trivial reward system onto existing teaching materials and/or assessments. Nevertheless,
a gamified, multi-dimensional, problem-based learning approach can yield improved results even when applied to a very
complex and traditionally dry task like the teaching of computer programming, as shown in this paper. The presented
quasi-experimental study used a combination of instructor feedback, real time sequence of scored quizzes, and live coding
to deliver a fully interactive learning experience. More specifically, the “Kahoot!” Classroom Response System (CRS), the
classroom version of the TV game show “Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?”, and Codecademy’s interactive platform formed
the basis for a learning model which was applied to an entry-level Python programming course. Students were thus
allowed to experience multiple interlocking methods similar to those commonly found in a top quality game experience. To
assess gamification’s impact on learning, empirical data from the gamified group were compared to those from a control
group who was taught through a traditional learning approach, similar to the one which had been used during previous
cohorts. Despite this being a relatively small-scale study, the results and findings for a number of key metrics, including
attendance, downloading of course material, and final grades, were encouraging and proved that the gamified approach
was motivating and enriching for both students and instructors.

  notes = {
  Initial impression: gamifying a entry level python class with kahoot and codeacademy. Seems to be interesting
  
  * Heavy use of buzzwords in intro is kinda eh
  * The rest of the intro sounds fine. 
  * While a lot of these papers talk about motivation and so on contrary to education I feel like the forget that one of the reasons we keep going on in games despite failure is that they dont really have that much consequence. You might lose some progress in a game, but you are free to try again and improve as a player. This is not really something that is applied to a real life context.
  * Badges and points are extrinsic motivators tbh, while there is mention of successful serious games using it, I dont think it impacts the learning outcome in the same way. 
    * It is mentioned to be a means of tracking student progress, which in a way sounds fine though. 
  
  * Mention in related work of a professor who gamified his own class by discarding grading in favour of exp and assignments into quests. Sounds like fun 
  * While I like the idea of turning a 1 hour lecture into three 20 minute components, Kahoot is not a perfect way of assessing knowledge as it rewards quick answering and not only knowing the right answer.
  * Public leaderboard of scores sounds kinda scary
    * In the worst case this would massively demotivate players with bad scores. 
  * "The thinking behind this decision was that rankings tap into people’s natural competitiveness and encourage them to do better, which might motivate students to study more by the desire to improve their position (Natvig et al., 2004)."
    * While sure, competitiveness can improve motivation it can also decrease it. Other studies have shown that cooperation actually can have better effects (Obese Diet serious game from lectures)
    * If you are the bottom of the leaderboards, will that really motivate you to improve?
    
  * What is the reasoning behind going for both kahoot and who wants to be a millionaire?
    * They are both very similar outside of scoring for time as well. 
    
  * I like the more collaborative concept of who wants to be a millionaire over kahoot, but the risk/reward of losing potential points towards your assessment can be a bit scary
    * The guaranteed point tiers are nice though. 
    
  * "These gamification features have been crucial to making Codecademy one of the most popular online education providers with over 24 million users to date (Richard Ruth, 2015) and were the main reason behind selecting it as the delivery platform for the programming exercises."
    * Are points and badges really that crucial though?
    * I personally always felt like the strength of codecademy was more their interactive tutorials instead of their point and achievement system. 
        * At the same time the scoring system is pretty fair here. No risk of losing points or not getting a good amount due to speed of answer. 
        * They tried to motivate students with challenges that had no rewards to see whether winning a challenge itself was enough of a intrinsic motivator. Fair enough, I would not like this decision if it was related to the actual student assessment. 
        
  * "Surprisingly enough, there were mixed opinions on whether game points should be translated into actual marks for module assessments"
    * I dont think that is so surprising given what I've mentioned earlier here. 
    
  * Parts of results could be placed in methods imo. 
  
  * The fact that kahoot worsened over time and that WWTBAM didn't is related to what I discussed earlier. 
    * This could also correlate to the fact that cooperation increases motivation more than competitiveness like the diet game study from the class discussions.

  shortenedSummary = {
   Introduction:
    * Video gamers are constantly kept at high levels of attention compared to standard lectures where your attention span is good for the first 10 min and then diminishes until a break is used to change the environment.
    * No short term wins or instant gratification when confronted with complex learning to keep students motivated. 
    * A promising way to address these counterproductive feelings is to design them with techniques similar to ones found in successful gaming environments.
    * Rather than assume that mobiles, laptops and what not are the cause of attention loss, educators should be open to new possibilities to teach and educate. 
        * Data points out that students who learn with video games have a significant improvement in subject understanding, diligence and motivation
    * dopamine is considered a key role in motivation, effect and learning.
        * Educational techniques that access the same methods could result in learning/reward cycles. 
    * When working with games, we are balancing around the player's skill level instead of a one size fits all lecture. 
        * Allows for less boredom and frustration
        * Better means of providing a state of flow
        
    * Self determination theory should be taken into account when working on gamification. 
        * Relatedness - the need to interact and be connected with others
        * Competence - the need to be effective and master a problem in a given environment
        * Autonomy - the need to control one's life
    * These elements have been shown to affect intrinsic and extrinsic motivation. 
    * Can take individual student fatigue into account to determine the optimal combination of intrinsic and extrinsic motivators. 
    
    * Research questions
        * Are students who use Codecademy and play “Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?” and “Kahoot!” more engaged in learning Python programming when compared to peers who engage in traditional class activities?
        * Do students who use Codecademy and play “Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?” and “Kahoot!” develop deeper understandings of Python programming when compared to peers engaged in more traditional instruction?
   
   Methods:
    * 12 week university course in introductory python.
        * Gamified using Kahoot, Codeacademy and a modified versions of Who Wants to be a Millionaire?
    * 2 consecutive academic years measured
    * Control group of 54 students (43m, 11f)
    * Experimental class of 52 students (44m, 8f)
    * Participants in the age ranfe of 19-25
    * 16 students in the experimental class were regular gamers, 28 played games occasionally and 8 did not play games at all.  
    * The first year was done with the control group
        * low attendance rates, numerous late to class arrivals, lack of interest in reference material outside of exam period. 
    * Students learn more when engaged with the content they are learning. 
    * Attention span decreases after the first 15-20 minutes into a lecture. 
   
   Gamifying the course:
    * Formative assessment with Kahoot
        * initial 1 hour lectures were replaced by 20 minute cycles of micro lecturing, a formative assessment in the form of a Kahoot game, and a brief discussion. 
        * Winner of Kahoot sessions got some candy
        * Visual display of weekly kahoot scores on a public leaderboard
    
    
    * Collaborative problem solving with "Who wants to be a millionaire"?
        * the 1 hour revision seminars were also changed. 
        * Q/A + lectures replaced with WWTBAM
        * For logistics reasons, they split the class randomly into four groups of 13 students (11 male, 2 female) who attended a separate seminar every week for a total of 12 weeks. 
            * Then randomly split into three teams of 4-5 members that remained the same for the rest of the course. 
        * No note taking was allowed by other students while a team was playing. 
        * No official time limit to answer a question, but each game could only last 20 minutes to give all the teams time to play once during the seminar. 
            * 4 multiple choice questions. 
            * Teams had to collaborate, reach a consensus and give a single response. 
        * Three lifelines
            * Poll the class
            * 50/50 - eliminate 2 incorrect answers
            * Ask a friend 
        * After viewing a questions several options are available
            * Refuse to answer, quit the game and retain all points earned to that point
            * Answer the question, potentially earning points or lose all of them if incorrect.
                * To elaborate, 5k and 100k tiers were guaranteed once achieved so if you answered wrong above those tiers you would just drop down to it. 
            * Use a lifeline. 
        
        * Once game was finished they reviewed the answers to all questions with the entire class.  
        * Leading team won chocolate bars at the end of the course for this game component. 
        * The game was also available for download at the end of every week for students who could not attend class. 
        
    * Practicing programming skills with Codeacademy
        * 36 lessons of Codeacademy's python track used for lab excercises. 
        * If students finished early they could get more exercises
        * Students who couldn't finish in time continue working on these at home at their own pace. 
        * In an effort to motivate students further and make them complete exercises as quickly as possible, the lecturers made a number of different challenges
            * To see if winning a challenge without rewards contributed as an intrinsic motivator. 
    
   Results: 
    * Online survey:
        * Students seemed to like it. 
        * Mixed opinions on whether game points should be translated to actual marks for module assessments. 
    * Semi structured interviews:
        * focus groups
            * (No elaboration on how these groups were chosen though.) 
            * (Full list of answer responses not provided.) 
        * extremely positive response(supposedly)
            * (Hard to say whether students chosen for this interview were cherry picked or not though.)
    * EG had higher attendance rate than CG
    * CG group had limited interest in reference material provided on a weekly basis while EG had slightly higher interest,
        * suggesting that they were motivated to study more because they wanted to perform well in the games. 
    * EG had the best overall academic performance. 
        * Average grade of 61\% compared to CG's 53\%
        * Low sample size so no correlation expected between gamification and performance. 
    
   Conclusion:
    * The findings suggest that using a multi-dimensional gamified learning approach has successfully achieved the pedagogical goals outlined in the introduction. 
    * Allows for the opportunity to experience first hand how to make learning fun and addictive
    * Kahoot was good
        * But student engagement decreased over time. Once students started trailing behind in the leaderboard they cared less. 
    * WWTBAM was good
        * Did not suffer like kahoot in terms of engagement. 
    * Codeacademy
        * Some error messages were too vague
        * Not all lessons were a good fit for the curriculum. 
        * ambiguous explanations
        * If a lesson was poor, students struggling with it got the impression that the topic was hard. 
    * Hard to say whether the improvement in engagement is due to short term novelty factors. 
    * Further study needs to be done to assess whether these methods really improve engagement and whether these methods can be applied to other subjects.

Students occasionally find it difficult to learn new programming languages. Previous work showed that students have experienced ineffective learning, lack of interest towards this course and lack of motivation. The rationale for this is that in previous studies, some researchers have mentioned the use of game elements but none have mentioned a gamification framework that integrates the requirements for learning programming language subjects. Therefore, this study proposed gamification framework that consists of game elements and programming learning requirements. This framework is verified by lecturers and students. The findings shown, the mean score of each combination of programming learning requirements and game elements is more than 4.00.

  In this paper, an inquiry‐based ubiquitous gaming approach was proposed. The objective of the study was to enhance students’ performances in in‐field learning activities. To show the advantages of the approach, an experiment was carried out to assess the effects of it on students’ learning achievement, motivation, critical thinking, and problem solving. Furthermore, the students’ behavioral patterns were investigated via content and sequential analysis methods. The experimental outcomes show that the approach promoted students’ performances of learning achievement and intrinsic motivation; moreover, the students’ perceptions of their problem solving and critical thinking were significantly promoted as well. The learning behavior analysis further show that the designated approach stimulated the participants to actively engage in field observation, comparison, and data searching in the context ware in‐field learning activity.

 Worldwide, the workforce requires professionals to master programming skills, regardless of their
knowledge domain. This demand has led higher education institutions to strengthen their programming
courses, which currently experience high dropout rates and low academic performance. Some institutions
have even faced the need to offer new programming courses for those students whose field is not computer
related, which adds more challenges due to their background. Given this setting, gamification, the use of game
elements in non-game contexts, is put forward as a solution to redesign related courses. Thus, the purpose of
this study was to analyse the impact of gamification, using badges, on learning performance, intrinsic
motivation, self-efficacy and engagement in engineering students taking a basic programming course. It also
analysed the effects of student background variables such as gender, grade point average and previous gaming
experience. One hundred sophomore undergraduates participated in a quasi-experiment, lasting 6 weeks. A
pretest-posttest design with control (N=50) and experimental group (N = 50) was setup. Students carried out
mandatory (e.g. chapter reading quizzes) and optional tasks (completing activities in Code Academy or
Pyschools), and were awarded with badges and meta-badges, through a web based application called Credly.
The university learning management system was used as a platform to inform students of the activities that
would be rewarded with and to keep track of the students’ assignments. Data collection methods included
self-reported questionnaires about intrinsic motivation, self-efficacy and personality; and a programming test.
Results show a statistically significant improvement in engagement in gamification students, compared to the
control group. However, no significant impact on learning performance, intrinsic motivation, self-efficacy and
any of the student background variables was observed. The higher engagement is promising, showing that
gamification might push programming courses. However, further research is needed to understand the lack of
connection between the aforementioned variables.

  abstract = {
  Using games in educational contexts is an old concept that got a renaissance in the 1980s when
Thomas Malone did an analysis of computer games and why they are fun and motivating. Later
Malone discussed his findings with similar results extracted from studies by Mark Lepper in a merger
that resulted in the Taxonomy of intrinsic motivation. How well designed digital games can support
intrinsic motivation has often been discussed in research during the last decades, but less has been
written on course design that stimulates learning for learning’s sake. In today’s blended learning with
an increased part of distance education there are several reasons to build courses on mechanisms
that strive for more than just having students to answer multiple choice questions. The aim of this
study is to explore how the various parts in the Taxonomy of intrinsic motivation might be used in
course development to design blended learning and online courses that motivate students without the
traditional carrots and sticks. This case study is based on a course in Games Based Learning (GBL)
where students build their own learning games based on presented and discussed GBL theories.
Data has been gathered from group discussions with students at examination seminars, evaluation
questionnaires, and online discussion fora in the virtual course platform. Findings show that the basic
components from the Taxonomy of intrinsic motivation have a potential to stimulate students both on
the level of internal motivation and on the level of interpersonal motivation. Ideas and theories for
learner motivation might also be presented to the students to stimulate the design of the game
prototypes. However, if a course built on the concept of intrinsic motivation is given simultaneously as
a course with sticks and carrots as prime motivational ingredients, the extrinsic motivation design in
the latter course will override the intrinsic motivation.

  Using digital games for educational purposes has been associated with higher levels of motivation
among learners of different educational levels. However, the underlying psychological factors involved
in digital game based learning (DGBL) have been rarely analyzed considering the self-determination
theory (SDT, Ryan & Deci, 2000b); the relation of SDT with the flow experience (Csikszentmihalyi,
1990) has neither been evaluated in the context of DGBL. Evaluating DGBL under the perspective of
SDT can improve the study of motivational factors in DGBL. In this paper, we aim to introduce the
LMGM-SDT theoretical framework, where the use of DGBL is analyzed through the Learning
Mechanics and Game Mechanics mapping model (LM-GM, Arnab et al., 2015) and its relation with the
components of the SDT. The implications for the use of DGBL in order to promote learners’ motivation
are also discussed.

  Programming environments and game environments
share many of the same characteristics, such as requiring their
users to understand strategies and solve difficult challenges. Yet,
only game designers have been able to capitalize on methods
that are consistently able to keep their users engaged. Consequently,
software engineers have been increasingly interested in
understanding how these game experiences can be transferred to
programming experiences, a process termed gamification.
In this perspective paper, we offer a formal argument that
gamification as applied today is predominately narrow, placing
emphasis on the reward aspects of game mechanics at the
expense of other important game elements, such as framing. We
argue that more authentic game experiences are possible when
programming environments are re-conceptualized and assessed
as holistic, serious games. This broad gamification enables us
to more effectively apply and leverage the breadth of game
elements to the construction and understanding of programming
environments.
