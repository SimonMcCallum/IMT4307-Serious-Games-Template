    abstract = { ABSTRACTObjective: Motivation is suggested as an important factor in pediatric motor rehabilitation. Therefore, we reviewed the existing evidence of (motivational) motor rehabilitation paradigms, and how motivation influences rehabilitation outcome using self-determination theory as conceptual framework. Methods: PubMed and Web-of-Science databases were systematically searched until June 2015. Data were independently extracted and critiqued for quality by three authors. Studies reporting motivational aspects were included. Most studies examined new technology (e.g., virtual reality [VR]). Results: Out of 479 records, three RCT, six case-control, and six non-comparative studies were included with mixed quality. Motivation was rarely reported. Training individualization to the child’s capabilities with more variety seemed promising to increase motivation. Motivation increased when the exercises seemed helpful for daily activities. Conclusions: Motivation in pediatric rehabilitation should be comprehensively assessed within a theoretical framework as there are indications that motivated children have better rehabilitation outcomes, depending on the aspect of motivation. }

The concept of serious games is increasingly popular and is considered as an innovative teaching practice since it is based on information and communication technology and gamification to foster learning. To this end, a serious game \"Perobo\" will be introduced and discussed. It is based on a set of gameplay techniques and pedagogical approaches used for teaching pointers, considered as a difficult concept in C programming language, and essential for programming complex and advanced programs. The game is also based on a taxonomy design to define the learning levels.},
